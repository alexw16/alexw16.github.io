I am currently a Senior AI Scientist at Genentech. I completed my PhD in the <a href='https://www.csail.mit.edu'>Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> at <a href='https://www.mit.edu'>MIT</a>, where I was supervised by <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/'>Bonnie Berger</a>. My most recent work and interests focus on developing graph machine learning and causal methods for identifying critical drivers of differentiation and disease from single-cell sequencing data. During my PhD, I was an intern with <a href='http://primemedicine.com'>Prime Medicine</a>, where I worked on machine learning for prime editing. I was also a research intern with <a href='https://cortex.twitter.com'>Twitter Cortex</a>, where I worked on causal methods for enhancing the performance of graph attention networks. Earlier on in my PhD and prior to my time at MIT, I also worked on designing Bayesian methods for small sample size settings, statistical methods for CRISPR screens, and machine learning methods for biological knowledge graphs.
